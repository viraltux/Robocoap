\description{
Function to generate a characters co-apperance matrix and characters timeline dataset within
a novel plus files formatted to be used in the Gephi network analysis tool.
}
\usage{
novel.coap(novel, characters, split = "Chapter", language = "english",
          encoding = "UTF-8", gephi = FALSE, plot = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{novel}{
path to a TXT or PDF file containing a novel or text itself.
}
  \item{characters}{
regexp expression containing characters names to analyze co-apperance.
}
  \item{split}{
keyword used to recognize different parts of the novel to establish co-apperance dynamics.
}
  \item{language}{
the language the novel is written on
}
  \item{encoding}{
text econding in the TXT file
}
  \item{gephi}{
flag to generate files formatted to be use with Gephi. The files name
are 'novel.coapnet.csv' and 'novel.coapnet.timeset.csv'.
}
  \item{plot}{
flag to plot the adjacency co-apperance matrix
}
}
\details{
In novels co-apperance (defined as the apperance of two consecutive
characters within split sections) will be similar to interactions among
characters (defined as characters being object of actions by other
characters). Check the example for further details.

Specific writing formats like theather plays or scientific papers  will
be handled in future releases.

Follow these steps in order to load the dynamic graph of coapperances in
Gephi:

1- 'novel.coapnet.csv':
    Gephi -> File -> Open [Directed] -> Ok
2- 'novel.coapnet.timeset.csv:
    Gephi -> File -> Import Spreadsheet -> Next -> Finish
}
\value{
A list contatining the following components:
\item{coapmat}{directed graph matrix describing co-apperance of the characters members}
\item{dynamic}{data set describing characters appearances considering the 'split' separator}

Optionally a plot of the adjacency co-apperance matrix or a set of two Gephi friendly files will be saved.

## Co-apperance vs Interaction Plots
## Co-apperance can be automatized, detect interactions is however a hard AI problem
## than can be approximated by the co-apperances when the story is long enough.
